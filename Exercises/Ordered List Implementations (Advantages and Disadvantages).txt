Ordered Lists

	Array List Implementation:
	* Advantages:
		-	Computationally fast when accessing elements.
		-	Static size, cheap in memory usage.

	* Disadvantages:
		-	Max size is determined in advance. Resizing may be a hassle and computationally expensive.
		-	Inserting/removing is computationally expensive; must move elements one by one through the list.

	Linked List (Pointer) Implementation:
	* Advantages:
		-	Inserting/Removing elements is computationally fast.
		-	Dynamic size, can support near infinite growth.

	* Disadvantages:
		-	Traversing is computationally expensive; by extension, accessing elements is also expensive.
		-	Increase in size also increases the hassle in traversal.
